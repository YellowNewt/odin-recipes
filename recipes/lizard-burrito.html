        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <h2> For the dough:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>160ml of water</li>
            <li>235g of strong white flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 and a half teaspoons of salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of dry yeast</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>For the toppings:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>200ml of passata</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of dry basil</li>
            <li>6 vine tomatoes</li>
        </ul>
        <h1> Steps</h1>
        <h2>Making the dough:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add all the ingredients in the bread maker in the order recommended by the manufacturer and run the "dough" cycle. Some machines have a dedicated "pizza" setting. If yours has it, use that instead.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, make the dough by hand by adding all the dry ingredients in a bowl, mix them well, and gradually add the olive oil and water until you have a dough that's now sticky. Leave it to prove for 1 - 1 Â½ hours.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Creating the pizza:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven at 230c</li>
            
        </ol>
